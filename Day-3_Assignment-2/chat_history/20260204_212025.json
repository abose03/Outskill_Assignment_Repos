In quantum physics, it describes phenomena at the atomic and subatomic levels, where classical mechanics no longer apply. Key principles include wave-particle duality, superposition, and entanglement. Particles, such as electrons and photons, exhibit both particle-like and wave-like behaviors. The uncertainty principle highlights limits to the precision of measuring certain pairs of properties. Quantum mechanics underpins various technologies, including semiconductors, lasers, and quantum computing, revolutionizing our understanding of the universe and leading to advancements in science and technology."
